    <dt>What is Art?</dt>
    <dd>According to Oxford Dictionary Art is “the use of the imagination to express ideas or feelings, particularly in painting, drawing or sculpture.”
        Art is beauty, talent and skill. Art can be anything that makes you smile or makes you feel and think. Many also believe that art is something that stirs emotions in you.</dd>

<i style="font-variant:monospaced">
Art is protest, bold and loud,<br>
It’s a canvas in a bustling crowd,<br>
A dance that tells a thousand tales,<br>
In every brushstroke, life unveils.<br>
<br><br>
In symphonies that reach the sky,<br>
In whispered winds, as they pass by,<br>
Art is everywhere we look,<br>
In every cranny, every nook.<br>
<br><br>
It’s the essence of the human soul,<br>
The pursuit of an endless goal,<br>
To capture truth and beauty rare,<br>
In forms that others too can share.<br>
<br><br>
So what is art? It’s undefinable,<br>
A force that’s truly undeniable,<br>
It’s the language of the heart, you see,<br>
Art is simply, to be free.

    <dt>Its Significance</dt>
    <dd>The fundamental sense of self is deeply entwined with the arts. A sentiment, the status of society, important historical moments, or a perspective through space and time can all be conveyed by an artist through various forms of expression. By portraying multiple perspectives and events over time, art has always been a creative approach to preserve history. The ability of art to express viewpoints that stood out and challenged the status quo has also contributed to its role as a forerunner of social change.</dd>

    <dt>Brief History</dt>
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating visual art is one of the defining characteristics of the human species, but the paucity of archaeological evidence means that we have limited information on the origin and evolution of this aspect of human culture.</li>
            <li>The components of art include colour, pattern and the reproduction of visual likeness.</li>
            <li>The 2D and 3D art forms that were created by Upper Palaeolithic Europeans at least 30 000 years ago are conceptually equivalent to those created in recent centuries, indicating that human cognition and symbolising activity, as well as anatomy, were fully modern by that time.</li>
            <li>The origins of art are therefore much more ancient and lie within Africa, before worldwide human dispersal. 
                The earliest known evidence of ‘artistic behaviour’ is of human body decoration, including skin colouring with ochre and the use of beads, although both may have had functional origins. Zig-zag and criss-cross patterns, nested curves and parallel lines are the earliest known patterns to have been created separately from the body; their similarity to ectopic phenomena (involuntary products of the visual system) suggests a physiological origin.</li>
            <li>3D art may have begun with human likeness recognition in natural objects, which were modified to enhance that likeness; some 2D art has also clearly been influenced by suggestive features of an uneven surface.</li>
            <li>The creation of images from the imagination, or ‘the mind’s eye’, required a seminal evolutionary change in the neural structures underpinning perception; this change would have had a survival advantage in both tool-making and hunting.</li>
            <li>Analysis of early tool-making techniques suggests that creating 3D objects (sculptures and reliefs) involves their cognitive deconstruction into a series of surfaces, a principle that could have been applied to early sculpture.</li>
            <li>The cognitive ability to create art separate from the body must have originated in Africa but the practice may have begun at different times in genetically and culturally distinct groups both within Africa and during global dispersal, leading to the regional variety seen in both ancient and recent art.</li>
            <li>At all stages in the evolution of artistic creativity, stylistic change must have been due to rare, highly gifted individuals.</li>
